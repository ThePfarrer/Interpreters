# Writing an Interpreter in Go
This project is based on Thorsten Ball's book [Writing an Interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com/). The book provides a step-by-step guide on building an interpreter for a programming language from scratch.

## Why This Project?
I am particularly interested in understanding parsers and how interpreters work under the hood. While following the book, I made modifications to some of the code covering more edge cases.
